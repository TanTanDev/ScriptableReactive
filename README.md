# ScriptableReactive
This repository is meant to be used as a submodule inside a Unity Project

Requires UniRX: https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx

UniRX is a reactive framework, making it possible to handle events and data, in extremely flexible ways.


This library adds onto that functionality, by being able to define const data, reactive properties, reactive events, through scriptable objects. This is great for decoupling data and events.

The core concept is quite similar to the talk Ryan Hipple gave on scriptable objects: https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk
